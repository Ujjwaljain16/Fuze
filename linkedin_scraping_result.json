Really appreciate your balanced take — it’s refreshing to see appreciation for Go even after seeing Rust’s raw power firsthand. Curious to hear more about where each language shined most in your experience!

But cgo is already very (really very) bad performance wise, so, it wouldn't be that great anyway I guess Like Reply 1 Reaction 2 Reactions Tushar Kalsi 🚀 Backend Engineer @ Airtel || Rust & Go || Building AI-Ready Infra || NIT Kurukshetra 3d Report this comment We had the same issue — our Go service was struggling with heavy data processing. Rewrote just that part in Rust, and boom 💥 — 2.5x faster and way cheaper to run.
