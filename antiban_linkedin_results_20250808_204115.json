Here's what you actually need to crack AI / ML / GenAI interviews in 2025:\n\n✅ 1. Solve Coding Problems - every single day\nMost people get rejected here without moving further. Companies will ask one DSA for sure:\n- Arrays, Strings, Hashmaps\n- Sliding window, Binary Search, Two pointers\n- Matrix traversal, Graphs, DP (optional but good to have)\n\nStudy material: LeetCode 150 / Striver's DSA sheet / GFG SDE sheet\nSet a target: 2 DSA questions/day = 60/month = a real confidence booster!\n\n✅ 2. Build Projects That Teach You and Impress Recruiters\nSkip toy datasets and MNIST clones. Instead, build real-world GenAI and ML projects like:\n- A Resume Screening Bot using LLMs\n- Fake News Detector from live RSS feeds\n- Multi-label Tag Predictor for articles / e-commerce products\n- Semantic Search App using Vector DBs\n\nBuild → Deploy → Document → Share (Linkedin / Reddit / X)\nThat’s the cycle, make sure you know end-to-end of a project.\n\n✅ 3. Master ML System Design — It’s Asked in Every Interview Now\nThis is a reminder that System Design is non-negotiable. Some case studies include:\n- Design a system that summarizes customer support tickets in real time\n- Walk me through how you'd deploy an LLM-based assistant.\n\nTrain yourself to:\n- Break down problems into small components\n- Identify edge cases, build evaluation metric\n- Choose trade-offs (accuracy vs latency)\n- Design for scale and data drift\n\nTip: Maintain a personal repo of 10+ system design case studies with diagrams.\n\nIf you maintain this healthy study routine for 2-3 months rigorously, you will be 100% ready for interview with confidence.\n______\nIf you need guidance and mentorship, book a 1:1 call with me.

Building confidence in how you can present yourself (not just what you say) is so so important in the job search. Tools that can help you to practice, polish, and prepare can go a long way.\nSharing this in case it helps: https://www.prepzo.ai Hope this supports someone trying to speak up for the role they deserve.
