Here's what you actually need to crack AI / ML / GenAI interviews in 2025:\n\n✅ 1. Solve Coding Problems - every single day\nMost people get rejected here without moving further. Companies will ask one DSA for sure:\n- Arrays, Strings, Hashmaps\n- Sliding window, Binary Search, Two pointers\n- Matrix traversal, Graphs, DP (optional but good to have)\n\nStudy material: LeetCode 150 / Striver's DSA sheet / GFG SDE sheet\nSet a target: 2 DSA questions/day = 60/month = a real confidence booster!\n\n✅ 2. Build Projects That Teach You and Impress Recruiters\nSkip toy datasets and MNIST clones. Instead, build real-world GenAI and ML projects like:\n- A Resume Screening Bot using LLMs\n- Fake News Detector from live RSS feeds\n- Multi-label Tag Predictor for articles / e-commerce products\n- Semantic Search App using Vector DBs\n\nBuild → Deploy → Document → Share (Linkedin / Reddit / X)\nThat’s the cycle, make sure you know end-to-end of a project.\n\n✅ 3. Master ML System Design — It’s Asked in Every Interview Now\nThis is a reminder that System Design is non-negotiable. Some case studies include:\n- Design a system that summarizes customer support tickets in real time\n- Walk me through how you'd deploy an LLM-based assistant.\n\nTrain yourself to:\n- Break down problems into small components\n- Identify edge cases, build evaluation metric\n- Choose trade-offs (accuracy vs latency)\n- Design for scale and data drift\n\nTip: Maintain a personal repo of 10+ system design case studies with diagrams.\n\nIf you maintain this healthy study routine for 2-3 months rigorously, you will be 100% ready for interview with confidence.\n______\nIf you need guidance and mentorship, book a 1:1 call with me.
